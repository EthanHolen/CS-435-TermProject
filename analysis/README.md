# Data Analysis Scripts

## Setup

    Edit generateData.sh:7 to grab the data you want.
      Date format is yyyy-mm-dd-hh
      Where any field can be replaced with a range e.g. dd = {01...07}, to grab the first seven days of a month.

    Run generateData.sh with './generateData.sh'
      The script may need to have its access permission changed to allow it to be exectuted with 'chmod +x generateData.sh'
