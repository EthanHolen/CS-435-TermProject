~35,000 push events per file
~25,000 non-push events per file
~744 files per month

60 api requests per hour
1440 API requests per day

~0.041 files can be completed per day

~18,083 days to complete one month


Fix: 
	- get authed, increases api request limit to 5,000 per hour: https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting
	- Perform api requests after 1st mapreduce job, Store output in hierarchy or process into later:  users -> repo -> message
	- Use multiple computer for API requests

Results:
	- 5000 api requests per hour
	- 120,000 API requests per day
	- Num of API requests = Number of repos instead of Number of push events
	- ~60% less API requests needed


	- ~12-16 files can be completed in one day
	- Estimated 53 days to complete one month with only one account
	- 18 days with 3

Further:
	- Only process even days of the month
	- Estimated 50 days to complete one month with only one account
	- 17 days with 3
